# Contributing to the Legacy Editor
>*This document is still in the process of being finalized and might be missing information*

## Installation
To start, you will need [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [NodeJs and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Clone the repository using git:
```
git clone https://github.com/digiholic/LegacyEditor.git
```

Enter the directory and install the dependencies
```
cd LegacyEditor
npm install
```
To run the program, use either `npm start` or `electron .` from the project directory. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is highly recommended for working with the LegacyEditor.

## Creating Issues
Most work on the Legacy Editor is done in service of solving a specific issue.

If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please make sure the following conditions are met before creating an issue:
1. Ensure you have pulled the latest code from the repository, in case the issue has already been resolved, or the feature already implemented
2. Check the [issues page](https://github.com/digiholic/LegacyEditor/issues) to see if it has already been reported. If it has been reported and you have any additional info to provide (steps to reproduce a bug, reporting a regression of a bug previously fixed, etc.) please add it as a comment on that issue instead of starting a new one. "Necro-posting" (commenting on an old issue that hasn't been looked at in a while) is preferable to creating duplicate issues.
3. Gather as much information as you can. For bugs, include steps to reproduce and attach any logs or error messages you encounter. For feature requests, include as much detail as possible about why it would be necessary and how you would like to see it implemented.
4. Repeat to yourself this mantra: "I am not in charge of prioritization and this ticket may not be worked on right away" and accept this as truth.

If all of the conditions have been met, feel free to create an issue reporting this bug or requesting this feature and a developer will pick up the issue whenever time permits.

## Branching and Merge Requests
